# CSC-113 AI Fundamentals: Unified Course Outline

**Version:** 2.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-01
**Structure:** 8 Modules (2 weeks each)
**Status:** Authoritative Source Document

---

## Course Philosophy

> "Failure is just exercise. Delete the branch and try again."

CSC-113 teaches AI fundamentals through professional practice. Students build **SAGE** (Scholar's Adaptive Growth Engine), a personal AI study assistant that grows throughout the semester, demonstrating how context design shapes AI behavior.

### Core Principles

- **GitHub-first workflow** from Day 1
- **Process documentation** over perfect products
- **AI collaboration is required** - using AI tools is the point, not cheating
- **Build to learn** - understanding comes from creating, not memorizing
- **Equal rigor, different paths** - both tracks develop sophisticated AI practitioners

### Two Tracks (Module 4+)

| Track | Focus | Tools | Deliverables |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------|
| **Code Builders** | Programming, APIs, technical implementation | Python, Codespaces, APIs | Working code, deployments |
| **Prompt Masters** | No-code tools, advanced prompting, business applications | AI Studio, Custom GPTs/Gems, No-code platforms | Sophisticated prompts, workflows |

---

## SAGE Context Document Schedule

Students progressively add context documents to SAGE, each serving dual purposes: making SAGE more capable AND teaching context design patterns.

| Module | Documents to Add | Pattern Demonstrated |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| **M01** | `SAGE-core.md`, `course-overview.md` | System prompting, domain context |
| **M02** | `github-basics.md`, `github-troubleshooting.md` | Procedural knowledge, error handling |
| **M03** | `prompt-engineering.md`, `ai-platforms.md`, `rate-limits-costs.md` | Meta-knowledge, comparative structures |
| **M04** | `debugging-guide.md`, `critical-evaluation.md` | Process-oriented problem solving |
| **M05** | `project-planning.md`, Track-specific doc | Planning frameworks, specialization |
| **M06** | Student-created original document | Creative application |
| **M07** | `portfolio-guide.md` | Self-presentation |
| **M08** | `presentation-prep.md` | Communication templates |

**Full SAGE Document Inventory:** See `assignments/sage/sage-file-list.md`
