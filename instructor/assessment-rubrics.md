## Core Assessment Philosophy

### What We're Actually Measuring

**✅ DO Grade:**
- AI collaboration effectiveness
- Critical evaluation of AI outputs
- Process documentation quality
- Professional workflow consistency
- Iterative improvement evidence
- Problem-solving approach
- Honest reflection and growth

**❌ DON'T Grade:**
- "Original" work without AI assistance
- Perfect technical implementation
- AI-free knowledge demonstration
- Comparison to pre-AI academic standards
- Quantity of code or complexity

### The "Checkmate" Principle

> "Course requires AI use for all assignments. This flips the academic integrity problem by making AI partnership mandatory and grading on collaboration quality."

**Key Questions:**
- How effectively does the student work with AI tools?
- Can they critically evaluate AI outputs?
- Do they understand what the AI did and why?
- Can they explain trade-offs and limitations?

## Observable Behaviors Guide

### What Excellent Work Looks Like

**In Prompts:**
```
❌ Novice: "help me code a calculator"

✅ Proficient: "Act as a Python tutor. Help me create a basic calculator 
that handles +, -, *, /. Use functions for each operation. Include error 
handling for division by zero. Explain each part as you go."

✅ Advanced: [Same as proficient, PLUS] "First, show me three different 
approaches to organizing this code. Then we'll pick one and iterate on it."
```

**In Documentation:**
```
❌ Novice: "I made a calculator. It works."

✅ Proficient: "## Calculator Implementation

I tested three approaches:
1. Single function with if/elif (too messy)
2. Separate functions (chosen - clearer)
3. Class-based (overkill for this task)

Chose #2 because [specific reasoning].

The AI initially suggested [X] but I modified it to [Y] because [reason]."

✅ Advanced: [Same as proficient, PLUS analysis of trade-offs, 
discussion of when different approaches would be better, connection to 
software design principles]
```

**In Reflection:**
```
❌ Novice: "This assignment was hard but I learned about AI."

✅ Proficient: "I discovered that more specific prompts give better results. 
My first attempt failed because I didn't specify the output format. After 
adding format requirements, the AI generated code I could actually use."

✅ Advanced: [Same as proficient, PLUS] "This taught me that human judgment 
is crucial in AI partnership - I need to evaluate outputs, not just accept 
them. Next project, I'll start by defining success criteria before prompting."
```

### Red Flags in Student Work

**Indicates Needs Improvement:**
- Empty or generic commit messages ("update", "fix stuff")
- No evidence of iteration or refinement
- Claims perfection or no problems encountered
- Defensive language about choices made
- Missing required documentation
- Copied prompts without customization
- No testing methodology visible
- Generic reflections without specific examples

**Indicates Possible Academic Integrity Issue:**
- Work dramatically exceeds demonstrated skill level
- No process documentation despite complex output
- Can't explain their own work in follow-up
- Identical to another student's work
- No evidence of AI collaboration (suspiciously AI-free)

### Peer Review Training (Week 2)

**Teach Students to Ask:**
1. "What problem were they trying to solve?"
2. "Does their solution address that problem?"
3. "What trade-offs did they make?"
4. "What's one specific thing they could improve?"
5. "What's one thing they did really well?"

**Provide Comment Templates:**

## Grading Philosophy Summary

### Remember

> "A perfect score doesn't mean a perfect product. It means: perfect understanding of the assignment, perfect execution of the process, perfect documentation of the journey, perfect honesty about the results."

### The "Slightly Less Terrible" Standard

From Bad Bot/Good Bot sequence:
- Best submissions often have the funniest remaining flaws
- Perfect bots miss the point
- Learning happens in iteration and constraint
- Process > Product

### Academic Honesty in AI-Required Work

**Red flags that need investigation:**
- No evidence of AI use (suspiciously AI-free)
- Can't explain their own documented process
- Work quality dramatically inconsistent
- Missing all process documentation

**NOT academic dishonesty:**
- Using AI extensively (that's required!)
- Getting help from AI on everything
- Simple solutions that work
- Borrowing ideas from examples (if cited)

## Quick Reference Card

### Four Categories Quick Check

**AI Partnership:** Did they iterate prompts? Evaluate outputs critically?  
**Problem-Solving:** Clear approach? Testing? Learning from failures?  
**Communication:** Documentation clear? Professional? Helpful reviews?  
**Critical Thinking:** Question AI? Consider ethics? Show growth?

### Scoring Guidelines

- **6.25 pts:** Exceptional work demonstrating mastery
- **5.5 pts:** Very good work, minor improvements possible
- **5.0 pts:** Solid proficient work
- **4.5 pts:** Good but needs strengthening
- **4.0 pts:** Developing, significant room for growth
- **<4.0 pts:** Needs major improvement or missing requirements

### Common Grading Questions

**Q: "Their code doesn't work but process is good. What grade?"**  
A: Focus on process! If they documented what they tried, why it didn't work, and what they learned, that's often more valuable than working code.

**Q: "They made the bot too helpful. Did they miss the point?"**  
A: For Bad Bot, yes. For Good Bot, maybe not - did they make ONE change that reduced friction while keeping personality? If so, that's the assignment.

**Q: "Their reflection is short. Does that matter?"**  
A: Quality > quantity. A short, insightful reflection beats a long generic one. But it should demonstrate actual thought.

**Q: "They clearly used AI for everything. Is that okay?"**  
A: YES! That's required! Grade on whether they used it WELL and critically evaluated the output.
