## 🎯 How to Use These Examples

### For Instructor Calibration
Before grading an assignment batch:
1. Review the excellent example to set your expectations
2. Review the poor example to see common mistakes
3. Use the four-category rubric consistently
4. Reference grading notes for borderline cases

### For Student Training
Share examples when:
- Introducing new assignments (show what excellent looks like)
- Students ask "what do you want?" (point to concrete examples)
- After first submissions (show range of quality with names removed)
- Teaching peer review (practice on these before real peers)

### For Peer Review Training
- Have students grade these examples in Week 2
- Compare student grades to instructor grades
- Discuss what makes feedback helpful
- Practice writing constructive comments

## 📋 Bad Bot / Good Bot Examples

### Excellent Submission: Alex Chen (24/25 - A)

**What Makes It Excellent:**
- Exactly one surgical change addressing highest-priority problem
- Character preservation while reducing friction
- Sophisticated trade-off analysis
- Meta-learning and transfer insights
- Professional documentation quality

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Constraints enhance creativity
- "Good enough" beats "perfect"
- Trade-offs are inherent in design
- Process matters more than perfection

**Use This Example To:**
- Set expectations for A-level work
- Show sophisticated trade-off thinking
- Demonstrate meta-learning
- Illustrate professional documentation

### Poor Submission: Jordan Smith (16/25 - C-)

**What Went Wrong:**
- Removed entire bot personality (not "one change")
- Missed assignment's core purpose
- No recognition of trade-offs
- Superficial reflection
- Technically competent but pedagogically off-target

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Technical execution ≠ understanding assignment goals
- Constraints are features, not bugs
- Character has value in design
- Perfect isn't always better

**Use This Example To:**
- Show common mistake (removing all friction)
- Illustrate missing-the-point patterns
- Teach about constraints as learning tools
- Demonstrate importance of engaging with goals

## 🎓 Grading Calibration Notes

### When Students Are Between Excellent & Poor

**Common In-Between Patterns:**

**B-Level Work (18-22 points):**
- Makes one clear change (follows rules)
- Some trade-off analysis but not deep
- Character mostly preserved
- Decent documentation
- Basic reflection without deep insights

**What Pushes B to A:**
- Exceptional insight in trade-off analysis
- Transfer learning evident
- Creative solution within constraints
- Professional-quality documentation
- Sophisticated meta-cognitive reflection

**What Drops C to D:**
- Multiple changes (breaking core rule)
- Complete character removal
- No testing or documentation
- Generic or missing reflections
- Doesn't address the problem identified

### Red Flags Requiring Discussion

**Possible Misunderstanding:**
- Claims "no trade-offs exist"
- "It's perfect now" with no remaining flaws
- Defensive about maintaining any friction
- Missing the constraint's purpose

**Response:** Meet with student to discuss design thinking and the value of constraints.

**Possible Academic Integrity Issue:**
- Work quality dramatically exceeds other submissions
- Can't explain their own process
- No iteration visible
- Copied from external source

**Response:** Request explanation of process, check for plagiarism, follow institution policy.

## 📊 Quality Spectrum Overview

### Assignment: Bad Bot / Good Bot

| Grade | Key Characteristics | Example |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| A (23-25) | Surgical change, deep analysis, meta-learning | Alex (24/25) |
| B (18-22) | Clear change, good process, adequate reflection | [TBD] |
| C (13-17) | Basic compliance, missing deeper purpose | Jordan (16/25) |
| D (8-12) | Multiple issues, weak process, poor docs | [TBD] |
| F (<8) | Missing requirements, no effort | [TBD] |

## 🔄 Using Examples for Different Purposes

### Week 1: Setting Expectations
Show excellent example (with student permission):
> "This is what A-level work looks like. Notice the trade-off analysis and meta-learning. You'll get there!"

### Week 3: Assignment Introduction
Share both examples (names removed):
> "Here are two approaches to this assignment. What makes one excellent and the other miss the point?"

### Week 4: Peer Review Training
Have students practice grading these:
> "Grade these two submissions using the rubric. Then we'll compare notes and discuss."

### Week 8: Portfolio Reflection
Show progression:
> "Look at your Week 3 work vs. these examples. How has your understanding grown?"

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Privacy Considerations
- Always get student permission before sharing work
- Remove names when using for general examples
- Don't identify "poor" examples as coming from specific students
- Focus on learning, not shaming

### Maintaining Currency
- Update examples each semester based on actual submissions
- Add examples for new assignment types
- Remove outdated examples (if tools/requirements change)
- Keep excellent examples that demonstrate timeless principles

### Avoiding Grade Inflation
- Don't lower standards to match average work
- Maintain distinction between good and excellent
- Explain WHY excellent is excellent (not arbitrary)
- Show improvement pathways from any starting point
