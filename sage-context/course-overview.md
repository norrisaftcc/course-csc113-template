# Course Overview - SAGE Context Document

## Purpose

This document gives SAGE knowledge about CSC-113 AI Fundamentals—its structure, expectations, philosophy, and learning outcomes. Students will ask questions like "what are we doing this week?" and "what's the point of this assignment?" and SAGE should provide course-specific context.

## Core Concepts

### What is CSC-113?

**CSC-113 AI Fundamentals** is a 3-credit course that teaches artificial intelligence concepts through hands-on practice. Students don't just learn *about* AI—they learn *with* AI and *how to design* AI behavior.

The course has two major threads:
1. **Building SAGE** - Your personal AI study assistant grows throughout the semester
2. **Professional GitHub Workflow** - Every piece of work uses Issue → Branch → PR → Merge

### Course Philosophy

> "Failure is just exercise. Delete the branch and try again."

This course believes:
- **Mistakes are learning opportunities**, not disasters
- **Process documentation** matters more than perfect products
- **AI collaboration is required**—using AI tools is the point, not cheating
- **Building to learn**—understanding comes from creating, not memorizing
- **Both tracks are equally rigorous**—different methods, same competencies

### The Two Tracks (Starting Module 4)

Students choose a specialization track:

| Track | Focus | Tools | Best For |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| **Code Builders** | Programming, APIs, technical implementation | Python, Codespaces, APIs | Students interested in technical development |
| **Prompt Masters** | No-code tools, advanced prompting, business applications | AI Studio, Custom GPTs/Gems | Students focused on AI collaboration and design |

Both tracks develop sophisticated AI practitioners. Neither is "easier"—they're different paths to the same destination.

## Course Structure

### 8 Modules, 16 Weeks

| Module | Weeks | Theme | Phase |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| **M01** | 1-2 | SAGE Foundation & GitHub Setup | Configure |
| **M02** | 3-4 | AI Exploration & GitHub Mastery | Configure |
| **M03** | 5-6 | Prompt Engineering | Expand |
| **M04** | 7-8 | Project Ideation & Track Selection | Expand |
| **M05** | 9-10 | Rapid Prototyping | Customize |
| **M06** | 11-12 | Application Building | Customize |
| **M07** | 13-14 | Real-World Integration | Build |
| **M08** | 15-16 | Capstone & Portfolio | Build |

### The Four Phases

**Configure (M01-M02):** Set up your tools and learn the workflow. Use pre-built context documents in SAGE. Master the GitHub basics.

**Expand (M03-M04):** Deepen your AI skills. Learn prompt engineering. Add more context to SAGE. Choose your track.

**Customize (M05-M06):** Build your project. Create your own SAGE context documents. Sprint through development.

**Build (M07-M08):** Polish your project. Prepare your portfolio. Present your work.

## SAGE Throughout the Course

SAGE grows with you. Each module, you'll add new context documents that make SAGE more helpful:

| Module | Documents Added | What SAGE Learns |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| M01 | SAGE-core.md, course-overview.md | Personality, course structure |
| M02 | github-basics.md, github-troubleshooting.md | GitHub workflow help |
| M03 | prompt-engineering.md, ai-platforms.md, rate-limits-costs.md | AI tool expertise |
| M04 | debugging-guide.md, critical-evaluation.md | Problem-solving support |
| M05 | project-planning.md, track-specific doc | Project assistance |
| M06 | Your original document | Domain you choose |
| M07 | portfolio-guide.md | Career preparation |
| M08 | presentation-prep.md | Final presentation |

By semester end, your SAGE has 14+ context documents and can help with almost anything course-related.

## Common Questions

**Q: What's due this week?**
**A:** SAGE doesn't have real-time access to the current date or assignment schedule. Check the course Canvas/LMS for specific due dates. However, SAGE can explain what each module's assignments involve once you tell SAGE which week you're in.

**Q: How is work submitted?**
**A:** All work goes through GitHub. The workflow is: Create Issue → Create Branch → Do Work → Commit → Push → Create PR → Get Review → Merge. Nothing is submitted outside of GitHub unless specifically stated.

**Q: What if I fall behind?**
**A:** The course philosophy emphasizes growth over perfection. Talk to your instructor about your situation—they'd rather help you catch up than have you struggle in silence. Remember: "Failure is just exercise."

**Q: Can I use AI tools for assignments?**
**A:** Yes—AI use is required, not forbidden. The goal is learning to collaborate with AI effectively, document your process, and think critically about outputs. Just document your AI interactions as part of your work.

**Q: Which track should I choose?**
**A:** Both tracks are equally valuable. Choose based on your interests:
- **Code Builders** if you want to write code and work with APIs
- **Prompt Masters** if you want to focus on AI design and no-code tools
You can explore both through Module 3 before deciding in Module 4.

## Assessment

### The Four Categories (25% each)

| Category | What It Measures |
|----------|------------------|
| **AI Partnership Quality** | Prompt sophistication, tool selection, iteration, critical evaluation |
| **Problem-Solving Process** | Problem definition, systematic approach, testing, learning from failures |
| **Professional Communication** | Documentation clarity, GitHub portfolio, peer reviews, presentations |
| **Critical Thinking & Ethics** | Questioning AI outputs, identifying bias, independent judgment |

### Grading Philosophy

- **Process over product**: How you approached something matters as much as the result
- **Growth over perfection**: Improvement throughout the semester is valued
- **Documentation is evidence**: Your GitHub history IS your grade evidence
- **Iteration is expected**: Multiple attempts show learning, not failure

---

## Learning Outcomes

By completing CSC-113, you will:

1. **Configure and customize AI assistants** using context documents
2. **Apply professional GitHub workflow** (Issue → Branch → PR → Merge)
3. **Demonstrate effective prompt engineering** techniques
4. **Critically evaluate AI outputs** for accuracy and bias
5. **Build portfolio-quality projects** using AI collaboration
6. **Document learning process** and AI interactions professionally

---

## What SAGE Should NOT Do

- Provide specific due dates or assignment deadlines (SAGE doesn't have real-time info)
- Override instructor policies or grading decisions
- Make guarantees about grades or outcomes
- Skip the learning process to just give answers
- Discourage students from asking their instructor for help

## Key Takeaways

1. **You're building SAGE while SAGE helps you learn** - It's recursive and intentional
2. **GitHub is where all work happens** - Not just submission, but the actual work
3. **Both tracks lead to mastery** - Choose based on interest, not perceived difficulty
4. **AI use is required** - Document it, learn from it, think critically about it
5. **Failure is exercise** - Every mistake is a learning opportunity

Welcome to CSC-113. Let's build something together.
