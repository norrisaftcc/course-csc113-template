## INSTRUCTOR IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### First Time Teaching This Course

**Month Before:**
- Complete GitHub organization setup
- Recruit community partners
- Prepare Week 1-2 materials completely
- Test all AI tools and rate limits

**Week 1:**
- Set expectations clearly
- GitHub workflow demonstration
- "Failure is exercise" culture establishment
- Daily standup ritual begins

**Ongoing:**
- Review GitHub activity daily (5 min)
- Approve PRs within 24 hours
- Intervene when students stuck 3+ days
- Maintain "Kevin from IT" persona

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Don't teach Git commands first - web interface only initially
- Don't let students commit to main - protection from day 1
- Don't skip daily standups - ritual is important
- Don't panic when AI tools change - teaching adaptability

### Budget Considerations

**Free Tier Management:**
- Gemini Flash cascade (Flash-Lite → Flash → Pro)
- 900 requests/day/student target (leaves buffer)
- Monitor rate limits Weekly
- Have backup tools ready

**GitHub Education:**
- Apply early (takes 1-3 days)
