# CSC-113 AI Fundamentals - Course Overview

## Course Basics

**Course:** CSC-113 AI Fundamentals
**Credits:** 3
**Prerequisites:** None
**Duration:** 16 weeks (8 modules × 2 weeks each)

-----

## What This Course Is About

CSC-113 teaches students to work effectively with AI tools while understanding how they work. This is not a traditional lecture-and-test course—students learn by building.

### Core Philosophy

- **“Failure is just exercise”** - Mistakes are expected and valuable
- **Professional workflow from Day 1** - Students use industry-standard GitHub practices
- **AI collaboration is required** - Using AI tools is the point, not cheating
- **Build to learn** - Understanding comes from creating, not memorizing

### What Students Will Build

The main project is **SAGE** (Scholar’s Adaptive Growth Engine)—a personal AI study assistant that grows throughout the semester. Students also complete community partner projects applying their skills to real-world problems.

-----

## The Four Phases

### Phase 1: Configure (Weeks 1-4)

Students set up and use AI tools with pre-built configurations.

- Set up SAGE using Claude Projects or Gemini Gems
- Learn GitHub workflow (Issues, branches, PRs)
- Add instructor-provided context documents
- Experience how context improves AI responses

### Phase 2: Expand (Weeks 5-8)

Students start creating their own context and understanding why it works.

- Write original context documents
- Explore Google AI Studio
- Learn prompt engineering principles
- Complete “SAGE Foundation” project

### Phase 3: Customize (Weeks 9-12)

Students specialize based on their interests.

- **Prompt Masters track:** Focus on conversation design, no-code AI tools
- **Code Builders track:** Focus on APIs, Python, application development
- Build enhanced SAGE with new capabilities

### Phase 4: Build (Weeks 13-16)

Students create deployable applications and complete capstone projects.

- Build Streamlit/Gradio applications
- Complete community partner project
- Finalize portfolio
- Present work

-----

## Weekly Structure

Each week typically includes:

- **Standup ritual** - Brief check-ins about progress and blockers
- **Concept introduction** - Short explanations of new ideas
- **Hands-on work time** - Building and experimenting
- **Reflection** - Documenting what was learned

-----

## GitHub Workflow

All work in this course uses professional GitHub practices:

1. **Create an Issue** - Define what you’re going to do
1. **Create a Branch** - Work in isolation from main
1. **Do the Work** - Code, write, experiment (in Codespaces or locally)
1. **Commit Often** - Save progress with meaningful messages
1. **Create a Pull Request** - Request review of your changes
1. **Get Review** - Receive feedback from peers or instructor
1. **Merge** - Integrate your work into main

**Important:** Students cannot commit directly to the main branch. All changes go through pull requests. This prevents disasters and teaches professional habits.

-----

## Assessment Approach

This course does NOT use traditional exams. Assessment is based on:

### Portfolio Quality (ongoing)

- GitHub profile professionalism
- Commit history showing consistent progress
- Issue tracking demonstrating project management
- PR reviews showing collaborative skills

### Project Milestones

|Grade|Milestone |What It Demonstrates |
|-----|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
|C |SAGE Foundation |Can use and modify AI context |
|B |SAGE Enhancement|Can create effective context and customize |
|A |Full Portfolio |Can design AI systems and complete real projects|

### Key Skills Assessed

1. **AI Partnership** - How effectively you work with AI tools
1. **Problem-Solving Process** - How you approach challenges
1. **Professional Communication** - Documentation and collaboration quality
1. **Critical Thinking** - Evaluating AI outputs, ethical reasoning

-----

## Key Concepts Students Will Learn

### AI Fundamentals

- What AI is and isn’t
- How large language models work (conceptually)
- The role of training data and context
- Limitations and appropriate uses

### Prompt Engineering

- How to write effective prompts
- The role of context, examples, and constraints
- Iteration and refinement strategies
- Platform differences (Claude, Gemini, etc.)

### Context Design

- How context documents shape AI behavior
- Writing effective knowledge for AI consumption
- Testing and improving context
- Transferring skills to new domains

### Professional Workflow

- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Issue-driven development
- Code review and collaboration
- Documentation practices

-----

## Tools Used

### Required (Free)

- **GitHub** - Version control, project management, portfolio
- **Claude** (claude.ai) or **Gemini** (gemini.google.com) - AI platforms
- **GitHub Codespaces** - Cloud development environment

### Introduced Later

- **Google AI Studio** - More control over AI configuration
- **Streamlit** or **Gradio** - Building web applications
- **Python** - For Code Builders track

-----

## Important Course Policies

### AI Use

AI use is **required**, not prohibited. Students must:

- Document their AI interactions
- Critically evaluate AI outputs
- Understand how and why their AI tools work
- Be able to explain their collaboration process

### Collaboration

Students are encouraged to:

- Help classmates in discussions and Discord
- Review each other’s pull requests
- Share what they learn
- Work together on understanding (not copying)

### Late Work

The GitHub-first workflow means progress is always visible. Students should:

- Communicate early if struggling
- Keep commits flowing even on difficult days
- Ask for help via Issues or discussion

-----

## SAGE Context Documents

Throughout the semester, students add context documents to SAGE:

|Week|Document |What It Adds |
|----|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
|1 |SAGE-core.md |Personality and interaction style|
|1 |course-overview.md |Course structure knowledge |
|2 |github-basics.md |GitHub workflow help |
|3 |github-troubleshooting.md |Error diagnosis |
|4 |prompt-engineering.md |Prompting guidance |
|4 |ai-platforms.md |Tool comparison |
|5 |rate-limits-costs.md |API management |
|6 |debugging-guide.md |Problem-solving process |
|7 |critical-evaluation.md |Output assessment |
|9+ |Track-specific docs |Specialization knowledge |
|13+ |Portfolio and presentation|Final phase support |

Each document makes SAGE more capable AND teaches students how AI context works.

## Getting Help

When students are stuck:

1. **Ask SAGE** - Your AI assistant may have the answer
1. **Check documentation** - Course materials cover most issues
1. **Ask peers** - Classmates face similar challenges
1. **Post in discussions** - The community can help
1. **Ask instructor** - For policy, grading, or persistent issues

### Instructor Office Hours

Check the course schedule for current office hours. For technical questions outside office hours, post in the course discussion forum.

-----

## Success in This Course

Students who succeed in CSC-113 typically:

- **Commit regularly** - Small progress every day beats weekend cramming
- **Document their process** - Learning is visible in their Issues and PRs
- **Embrace failure** - Broken things teach more than perfect first tries
- **Help others** - Teaching reinforces understanding
- **Stay curious** - The best projects come from genuine interest

Remember: The goal isn’t perfect code or flawless AI responses. The goal is understanding how to work effectively with AI tools—and that understanding comes through practice, experimentation, and yes, failure.

**Failure is just exercise.**
