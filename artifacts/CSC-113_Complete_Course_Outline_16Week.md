## COURSE OVERVIEW

### Official Description
"This course provides a survey of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Topics include the history, development, and current applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Upon completion, students should be able to demonstrate general artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts."

### Course Philosophy
**"We're not teaching them to code. We're teaching them to learn."**

This course uses AI tools as the context for teaching second-order skills:
- **Documentation** - Clear communication of process and results
- **Resilience** - "Failure is just exercise" - iteration over perfection
- **Growth Mindset** - Learning from mistakes, celebrating progress
- **Critical Thinking** - Questioning AI outputs, understanding limitations
- **Professional Workflow** - GitHub-first from day one
