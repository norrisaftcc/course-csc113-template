## How to Use This Gallery

### For Students:
1. **Pick Your Fighter** - Choose one or create your own
2. **Implement Faithfully** - Use the prompt exactly as written
3. **Test It Out** - Try to actually use it for homework
4. **Document the Pain** - Screenshot the worst responses
5. **Find ONE Redeeming Quality** - Even terrible bots have a use case... somewhere

### For Instructors:
- These teach context-dependent design
- Show how constraints shape behavior
- Demonstrate user experience principles
- Make failure fun instead of frightening

### The Meta-Lesson:
Every one of these bots is perfectly functional... in the wrong context. Your job is to find where they'd actually be useful (hint: it might be nowhere, and that's okay).

*Remember: The goal isn't to build something useful. It's to build something SO SPECIFICALLY TERRIBLE that fixing it teaches you how AI actually works.*

## Want to Contribute?

Have a terrible bot idea? The formula is:
1. Clever acronym name
2. Specific dysfunction
3. Consistent personality
4. Still technically functional
5. Amusing to use (once)
