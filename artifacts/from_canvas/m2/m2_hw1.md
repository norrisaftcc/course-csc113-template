In this video, I will take you through all the steps to save all of your prompts to GitHub.

In this assignment, you will:

Identify a task that an AI agent tool ("llama") could possibly help you with 
Create HelperBot 1.0:
Give it a better name than that
Create a basic prompt that contains:
Persona: What the llama pretends to act like (such as "fellow student in your Calc class" or "Anime shounen sidekick")
Purpose: What the llama is actually supposed to do (such as "help me learn Calc" or "Help students write essays about manga")
Save your work to GitHub! (your unconscious will do this automatically after a while)
Modify the Persona to amplify some potential "friction" with the agent. Examples:
"Always talks in zoomer lingo 🔥✅" 
"CalcBot doesn't actually know calculus past Week 4"
"MangaBot cites the episodes for his cool one-liners but not the things i need cited"
"ResearchBot keeps talking about AO3 for some reason"
See the provided examples (if you want to really mess things up)
Save your changes to GitHub (we can always go back)
Test out the bot.
Does it work at all?
Is it ... annoying? Funny? Just weird? Or does it work anyway.
Remember what was funny or annoying or whatever, you'll need that for the Reflection assignment.

How do I test the prompts?

For now, if all this is new to you, just paste the prompt in to the chatbot window, and add your question to the end. (That's the simplest possible thing that could work -- a lot of copying and pasting, but guaranteed results.)

If you've used LLM tools before, then you may be familiar with "custom agents" such as "Custom GPTs" or "Gems". These are just pre-set agents that always have their prompt, so you don't have to copy and paste so much.
