CSC-113 AI Fundamentals: Final Project Submission
The Finish Line 🎯

(DUE DATE: Wed Dec 10, 3pm)

You've spent the semester prompting, iterating, experimenting, and building. Now it's time to package what you've created and reflect on what you've learned.

Due: One week from today
Estimated time: 2-3 days (if you've been keeping up with your project work)
Where: Your GitHub repository → project/ folder

What You're Submitting

Your final submission has three parts:

Part 1: Your Project (Whatever State It's In)

Upload everything related to your project to your repository's project/ folder:

Your prompts — The actual prompts you used (copy/paste from your AI conversations)
Your outputs — What the AI generated (screenshots, text files, code, images, etc.)
Any iterations — Show how your approach evolved over time
A working demo (if applicable) — Could be a link, a screenshot walkthrough, or exported files

Don't have a "finished" project? That's okay. Submit what you have. Incomplete work with good documentation of what you tried is more valuable than nothing.

Part 2: Your README

Create a README.md file in your project/ folder that answers:

What is this? (2-3 sentences explaining your project idea)
What does it do? (Or what was it supposed to do?)
How far did you get? (Be honest — "70% there" or "just a prototype" is fine)
What AI tools did you use? (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
Part 3: Your Reflection (The Important Part)

Create a file called REFLECTION.md in your project/ folder.

This is where you demonstrate what you actually learned this semester. Answer these questions thoughtfully:

Reflection Questions

About Your Process:

What was your biggest "aha moment" when working with AI this semester?
Describe a time when the AI gave you something useless. What did you do next?
How did your prompting approach change from Week 1 to now?

About What You Learned:

What's one thing you can do with AI now that you couldn't do in August?
What surprised you most about working with AI tools?
What's something AI is genuinely bad at that you discovered firsthand?

About What's Next:

How might you use AI tools in your other classes or your job?
What would you tell a friend who's never used AI tools to help them get started?
Is there anything you want to learn more about after this course?

Honest Assessment:

On a scale of 1-10, how confident do you feel working with AI tools now versus when the semester started? Why?
The "Escape Hatch" Option

Don't have a final project you're happy with?

You can choose to re-iterate on any previous assignment as your final project instead. Pick one of your earlier assignments and:

Improve it significantly based on what you've learned since then
Document what you changed and why
Complete the same README and Reflection requirements above

If you go this route, put everything in your project/ folder with a note at the top of your README explaining which assignment you're building on.

How to Submit (Step by Step)
For Everyone:
Go to your repository on GitHub
Navigate to (or create) the project/ folder
Upload your files:
Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
Drag and drop your project files
Click "Commit changes"
Create your README.md and REFLECTION.md:
Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
Name it README.md (or REFLECTION.md)
Write directly in the browser
Click "Commit changes"
Checklist Before You Submit:
[ ] project/ folder exists in my repository
[ ] Project files are uploaded (prompts, outputs, demos, etc.)
[ ] README.md answers the four questions
[ ] REFLECTION.md answers the reflection questions thoughtfully
[ ] I can view my files when I visit my repository

Grading: What We're Looking For
Component	What Earns Full Credit
Project Files	Submitted something — complete or in-progress
README	Clear explanation of what you built and how far you got
Reflection	Thoughtful, specific answers that show genuine learning
Honesty	Realistic assessment of your work and growth

Note: A thoughtful reflection on an incomplete project will score better than a polished project with a shallow reflection. We want to see what you learned, not just what you made.

Questions?

Email the instructor directly. Given that it's finals time, email is the fastest way to get answers.

Don't wait until the last day if you're stuck on something — reach out early.

Final Thought

You've been working with AI all semester. You've written prompts, hit rate limits, gotten garbage outputs, figured out workarounds, and (hopefully) built something you're at least a little proud of.

That experience? That's the point.

Whether your project is polished or barely functional, you now know how to collaborate with AI tools — how to prompt effectively, iterate when things don't work, and think critically about what AI can and can't do.

That's a skill most people don't have yet. And you developed it by doing the work.

Now show us what you learned.

"Failure is just exercise. What did you learn from it?" — Course Mantra

FINAL FINAL THOUGHT:

If you read all the way to the bottom, I hope this additional README is useful. :^)
