# Module 1 assignment 2

Hello, G-Flash!

A note on terminology: I get tired of typing "LLM-based AI agent tool" so we're going with "llama". 

I'm assuming you're using at least one LLM ("llama") already, so to identify how it feels to "meet" a new llama, we're going to give everyone a new one.

You'll meet your new llama, Gemini Flash ("G-Flash"), by:

Logging into a Google account (not a school account, your own Google account)
Visiting https://gemini.google.com/ .

Create something (so, ask a question, make an image or a simple webpage, create a storybook, ...) and either:

Paste what you did into the text entry field, or
Submit the URL of the item you shared (make sure you can access that link, please check it!)

Frequently Asked Questions:

"Create something"? That's way too vague to be an assignment!

OK, then run this prompt: "Using the knowledge that the user is [what you do] and is interested in [your special interest], explain five ways that Generative AI tools could make my [things i do] easier."

You still have to fill in the [blanks], but now you don't have a blank page to start with.
