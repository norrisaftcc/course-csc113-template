Assignment 1: GitHub Profile Setup 

Short version: Read this, or have G-Flash explain it.

Step 1: GitHub Account (5 min)
Sign up at github.com with a professional username (this is permanent!)
✅ Good: sarah-chen, james-dev, alex-codes
🆗 Okay: norrisaftcc, norrisa8373
⚠️ Avoid: coolgamer99, test-account-delete-later
Enable 2FA (Settings → Password and authentication) if you want to (this will mean you can't use GitHub without your phone on you!)
Understand that you'll probably get a class organization invite in a week or two, when things settle down.
Step 2: Create Your Profile README (10 min)

The Magic Repository (all in browser):

Click "+" → New repository
CRITICAL: Name it EXACTLY your username (if you're sarah-chen, name it sarah-chen)
✓ Public, ✓ Add README, Create
Step 3: Make It Yours (15 min)

Click pencil icon on README, replace with:

# Hi, I'm [Your Name] 👋

## About Me
Currently taking CSC-113 AI Fundamentals and learning to collaborate with AI tools!

## My Foo 🎯
[YOUR PASSION HERE - be specific! Are you into vintage synthesizers? 
Competitive origami? Urban sketching? This is what makes you memorable!]

## Currently Learning
- 🤖 AI collaboration and prompt engineering
- 🐙 GitHub workflows and version control
- 💡 Building my first AI assistants

## Fun Fact
[Something unexpected about you]

## Find Me
- 📫 Right here on GitHub!


Commit with message: "Add initial profile with personality"

HINT: Yes, you can use G-Flash to help you write this, or to help you make it look the way you want it. 

Step 4: Submit

Your profile link: https://github.com/[your-username]

Remember: Your "foo" is what makes you memorable. A recruiter won't remember "computer science student #47" but they WILL remember "the person who builds medieval siege weapons in their spare time"!

Great work! If you had any issues, or hit any snags, email your instructor!
