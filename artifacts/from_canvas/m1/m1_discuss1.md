D.0.1 AI Tools in Everyday Life

NOTE: In order to complete this assignment, I highly recommend you finish Module 1 of "Generative AI for Everyone". Dr. Ng will mention a number of everyday tools that use AI, which will make it easy to answer this question.

As a reminder, the course is available FREE here: https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-for-everyone/

Today's Question: Where is there in AI in tools that you're already using?

If you use ChatGPT or Copilot or Claude or Gemini regularly, then of course that counts. 

If you use our work Microsoft tools, they all have AI embedded in them, as well.

Anyone who listens to music on Spotify or watches videos on YouTube is being served AI-generated playlists.

What other examples can you think of? 

Grading is based on participation, not details -- the important thing is that you give your own answer!
