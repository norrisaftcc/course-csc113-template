Assignment 4.1: Research Ideation - Finding
Your AI Application Project
Overview
This assignment marks the beginning of your capstone project for CSC-113. You'll
brainstorm at least three potential ideas for how you could use AI tools to solve a
real problem or create something useful in your life. Remember: this is just ideation
- you're exploring possibilities, not committing to anything final yet.
Due Date: Oct 19 (we'll do another pass on this, so consider it a "submitted rough
draft") Points: 20
Format: GitHub Issue OR folder submission (see options below)
What is "Ideation"?
Ideation is the creative process of generating and exploring ideas. Think of it as
brainstorming without judgment - the goal is to come up with possibilities, not
perfect solutions. You might:
Suggest the same basic idea three different ways
Propose one wildly ambitious idea and two modest ones
Explore completely different directions
There are no bad ideas in ideation. Even ideas that seem impractical can lead to
better ones.
Assignment Requirements
1. Choose Your Submission Format
Option A: GitHub Issue (Recommended)
Create an Issue in your portfolio repository
Title: Project Ideation: Three AI Application Ideas
Include all three ideas in the Issue description
Option B: File Upload
Create a folder in your repository: project-ideas/
Include a README.md file with your ideas
See folder structure template below
2. Propose At Least Three Ideas
For each idea, provide:
Title: A short, descriptive name (3-8 words)
Problem/Goal: What problem does this solve or what do you want to create? (2-3
sentences)
AI Tool(s): Which AI tool(s) might you use? (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, custom
API, etc.)
Why This Interests You: Personal motivation for this project (1-2 sentences)
Rough Scope: Is this a one-weekend project, a multi-week effort, or something
in between?
Folder Structure Template (Option B)
If you choose the file upload option, create this structure:
project-ideas/
└── README.md
Your README.md should follow this template:
# Project Ideation - [Your Name]

Prompts to Help You Brainstorm
If you're stuck, try asking AI tools these questions:
Discovery Prompts
I'm a [your major] student looking for an AI project idea.
What problems in my daily life could AI help solve?
What are some creative uses of [specific AI tool] that
would make a good semester project for a college student?
I'm interested in [your hobby/interest]. How could I use
AI to make something useful related to this?
Refinement Prompts
I want to build [your rough idea]. What would make this
more interesting or unique?
How could I scale down [ambitious idea] into something
achievable in 2-3 weeks?
What are three different ways I could approach [your general idea]?
Reality Check Prompts
I'm thinking about [your idea]. What technical skills
would I need? What could go wrong?
Is [your idea] too ambitious, too simple, or just right
for a college AI fundamentals course?
What Makes a Good Project Idea?
 Good Project Characteristics
Solves a real problem in your life or someone else's
Uses AI meaningfully - not just for the sake of using AI
Achievable scope - you can finish in the time available
Demonstrates learning - shows what you understand about AI
Portfolio-worthy - something you'd want to show employers or grad schools
Personally interesting - you're motivated to work on it
 Warning Signs
Too vague - "Use AI to help students" (help them do what?)
Too simple - "Ask ChatGPT a question" (that's just using a tool, not a project)
Too ambitious - "Build the next Google search engine" (scale it down!)
Not AI-focused - "Build a website" (where's the AI component?)
Purely hypothetical - "AI that could cure cancer someday" (focus on what you
can actually build)
Grading Criteria
This assignment is graded on completion and effort, not on the quality of your final
project ideas.
Full Credit (20 points):
At least three distinct ideas proposed
Each idea includes all required components
Shows genuine thought and effort
Properly formatted as GitHub Issue OR in project-ideas folder
Partial Credit (10-15 points):
Only 1-2 ideas provided, OR
Ideas lack detail in required components
No Credit (0 points):
Assignment not submitted, OR
Minimal effort (generic/vague ideas with no detail)
What Happens Next?
After this ideation phase:
1. Week 2: You'll get feedback and refine your favorite idea
2. Week 3: You'll create a detailed project proposal with timeline
3. Weeks 4-7: You'll work on building your project
4. Week 8: Final presentation and reflection
For now, just focus on exploring possibilities. The best projects often start with
brainstorming multiple options before choosing the most exciting and achievable one.
Submission Instructions
If Using GitHub Issue (Option A):
1. Create the Issue in your portfolio repository with the exact title: Project
Ideation: Three AI Application Ideas
2. Include all three ideas in the Issue description
3. @mention the instructor when ready for review
4. Submit the Issue URL to [Learning Management System]
If Using Folder Upload (Option B):
1. Create project-ideas/ folder in your repository
2. Add README.md with your three ideas
3. Commit and push to your repository
4. Submit the repository URL to [Learning Management System]
Questions?
"Can I do something outside these examples?" - Absolutely! These are just
starting points.
"What if my ideas are too similar to each other?" - That's fine for ideation.
You're exploring different angles.
"Can I change my mind later?" - Yes! This is just brainstorming.
"Should I pick my favorite now?" - Not yet. You'll get feedback before
deciding.
"What if all my ideas seem bad?" - Share them anyway. Often "bad" ideas lead to
great ones with feedback.
"Which submission format should I use?" - Use whichever feels more comfortable.
GitHub Issues are quicker; folders keep everything organized.
Remember
"Failure is just exercise. Delete the branch and try again."
This applies to ideation too. Not every idea needs to be perfect. The goal is to think
creatively about how AI can be useful in your life. Start somewhere, see what sparks
interest, and iterate from there.
Get started by opening that Issue or creating that folder - even if your first idea is
rough!
