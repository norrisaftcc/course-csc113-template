# ALIGN: AI-Enabled Curriculum Development Pilot
## Executive Summary for Administrative Review

---

### The Opportunity

A cross-functional team of existing staff can demonstrate a sustainable model for AI-assisted curriculum development—**cutting development timelines by 40-60%** while improving quality—using CSC-113 AI Fundamentals as the proof-of-concept project.

**No budget transfer or new FTE required.** Only formalized collaboration time between existing professionals across departments.

---

### The Problem We're Solving

| Traditional Approach | Impact |
|---------------------|--------|
| Sequential handoffs between faculty and instructional designers | 6-12 month development cycles |
| Siloed work with limited collaboration | Intent degradation, revision loops |
| No systematic AI tool integration | Manual processes competitors have automated |
| Ad-hoc cross-departmental coordination | Dependent on informal relationships |

**For AI curriculum specifically:** Content becomes outdated before deployment. We cannot wait 6-12 months per course while peer institutions launch systemwide AI initiatives.

---

### The ALIGN Solution

**A**I-enabled **L**earning & **I**nstructional **G**eneration **N**etwork

A methodology combining:
- **Agile development** (2-week sprints, iterative feedback)
- **AI-assisted content creation** (prompt engineering for acceleration)
- **GitHub-based workflow** (transparent tracking, version control)
- **Cross-functional collaboration** (ID + developer + designer)

**Team Composition:**
| Role | Source | Time |
|------|--------|------|
| Software Developer | CIT Faculty | Existing workload |
| Instructional Design Specialist | ID/Accreditation staff | 4-8 hrs/week (protected) |
| Visual Designer | Design staff | Project-based |

---

### What We're Asking For

**Administrative mechanism (MOU + SLA) providing:**
- Protected collaboration time for one ID professional
- Formal recognition of cross-departmental partnership
- 16-week pilot duration with defined evaluation point

**We are NOT asking for:**
- Budget allocation or transfer
- FTE reallocation
- New hires
- Permanent restructuring

### What the Institution Gets

| Outcome | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **CSC-113 fully developed** | Portfolio-ready AI curriculum in 16 weeks |
| **Scalable methodology** | Documented process for additional courses |
| **Accreditation evidence** | HLC Criterion 5 demonstration of strategic planning |
| **AI readiness demonstration** | Visible institutional capability |
| **Professional development** | Staff skills in high-demand competencies |

---

### Benefits to Both Departments

**For the Lending Department (ID/Accreditation):**
- Professional development in AI-assisted methodology
- Credit on deliverables and institutional reporting
- Reusable templates and patterns
- Conference presentation opportunities

**For CIT:**
- Access to instructional design expertise
- Accelerated, higher-quality curriculum
- Scalable model for future development

---

### Risk Mitigation

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Workload conflict | Protected time blocks; clear priority protocol |
| Scope creep | Bounded pilot; defined deliverables; sprint planning |
| Sustainability | Documentation emphasis; pattern library for transfer |
| Precedent concerns | Defined pilot period with formal evaluation |

---

### Success Metrics

- **Timeline:** 8 weeks per module pair (vs. 6-12 months traditional)
- **Quality:** Zero critical accessibility issues; SME satisfaction 4+/5
- **Efficiency:** 40%+ improvement vs. traditional method
- **Scalability:** Documented methodology ready for additional courses

---

### Decision Requested

**Approve exploration of MOU/SLA framework** for cross-departmental collaboration, enabling the ALIGN pilot team to proceed with CSC-113 development.

**Next Steps if Approved:**
1. Consultation with ID/Accreditation leadership
2. Draft MOU language for legal review
3. Finalize time allocation and schedule
4. Initiate pilot (target: [semester])
