# AI-Enabled Instructional Design Specialist
## Embedded Collaboration Role—ALIGN Pilot Team

**Department:** Computer & Information Technology (Collaboration with Instructional Design)  
**Classification:** Internal collaboration assignment (protected time allocation)  
**Duration:** 16-week pilot, renewable based on outcomes  
**Time Commitment:** 4-8 hours weekly during active development cycles  
**Reporting:** Primary reporting unchanged; dotted-line collaboration with CIT development team

## Position Summary

The Computer & Information Technology department seeks an instructional design professional to join a cross-functional pilot team developing AI-integrated curriculum using the **ALIGN methodology** (AI-enabled Learning & Instructional Generation Network). This embedded collaboration role combines traditional instructional design expertise with emerging AI collaboration skills to accelerate curriculum development while maintaining quality, accessibility, and accreditation alignment.

The pilot project focuses on CSC-113 AI Fundamentals, with potential expansion to additional courses based on demonstrated outcomes. This is not a transfer or new hire—it's a formalized collaboration arrangement providing protected time for cross-departmental innovation.

## About ALIGN

ALIGN is an agile, AI-assisted curriculum development methodology that combines:

- **AI-enabled** content generation and iteration
- **Learning-focused** design principles and outcomes alignment  
- **Instructional** design expertise and quality assurance
- **Generation** of portfolio-ready course materials at accelerated timelines
- **Network** collaboration across functional boundaries

The methodology uses GitHub-based project management, sprint cycles, and continuous integration of AI tools to reduce development timelines by 40-60% while improving deliverable quality through iterative feedback.
