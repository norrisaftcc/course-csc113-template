**Secondary Audience:** CIT Faculty and Instructional Design Staff  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Classification:** Internal Planning Document

---

## Executive Summary

Community colleges face an urgent mandate to integrate AI competencies across curricula while simultaneously modernizing development workflows. This report proposes a **cross-functional pilot team** to demonstrate a sustainable model for AI-assisted instructional development, using CSC-113 AI Fundamentals as the proof-of-concept project.

The proposal requires **no budget transfer or FTE allocation**—only formalized collaboration time between existing staff across departments, structured through an MOU/SLA framework. The team combines software development expertise, instructional design with prompt engineering specialization, and visual design capabilities to accelerate curriculum development while building institutional capacity.

**Key Findings:**
- Industry now values prompt engineering as a core instructional design competency, with median salaries of $63K-$123K depending on role complexity
- Agile/Kanban methodologies reduce curriculum development cycles by 40-60% while improving quality through iterative feedback
- Cross-functional "outcome-aligned" teams outperform siloed departmental handoffs for curriculum innovation
- The pilot project (CSC-113) directly supports institutional AI readiness metrics and accreditation requirements

## Section 1: Problem Statement

### 1.1 The Curriculum Development Bottleneck

Traditional instructional development follows sequential, siloed workflows: faculty draft content → instructional designers format and structure → technical review → revision cycles → deployment. This "waterfall" approach creates predictable problems:

- **Extended timelines**: 6-12 months from concept to classroom
- **Handoff degradation**: Intent lost between subject matter experts and final delivery
- **Stale content**: Technology topics outdated before release
- **Resource inefficiency**: Multiple revision cycles consuming scattered time blocks

For AI-related curriculum specifically, these problems compound. AI tools evolve monthly; a course developed using traditional methods may reference deprecated features or miss critical developments before students encounter it.

### 1.2 The AI Readiness Imperative

External pressures demand acceleration:

- **Workforce requirements**: Microsoft's 2024 Work Trend Index found 66% of business leaders won't hire candidates without AI skills
- **Peer institution movement**: California Community Colleges launched the nation's largest systemwide AI partnership with Google; Mississippi's MAIN network spans the entire state system
- **Accreditation expectations**: HLC Criterion 5 requires demonstration of "systematic strategic planning for quality improvement" and responsiveness to external environment

The institution cannot wait 6-12 months per AI-integrated course. A fundamentally different development model is required.

### 1.3 The Resource Reality

Hiring dedicated AI curriculum specialists requires budget allocations that may not materialize in current fiscal environments. However, the institution already employs professionals whose combined expertise—if coordinated effectively—exceeds what any single new hire could provide:

- **Software development faculty** with hands-on AI tool experience and GitHub workflow fluency
- **Instructional designers** with prompt engineering skills developed through practice
- **Visual designers** capable of creating professional learning materials

The challenge is not capability but coordination. These resources exist in separate reporting structures with competing priorities and no formalized collaboration mechanism.

## Section 2: Industry Context and Employment Alignment

### 2.1 The Prompt Engineering Competency Emergence

Prompt engineering has emerged as a distinct professional competency with measurable market value. Current industry data indicates:

| Role Category | Median Salary | Key Competencies |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Entry Prompt Engineer | $63,000 | Basic LLM interaction, documentation |
| Instructional Designer (AI-enabled) | $79,000-$83,000 | Domain expertise + prompt engineering |
| Senior Prompt Engineer | $95,000-$123,000 | Multi-model fluency, workflow automation |
| AI Interaction Designer | $110,000-$150,000 | UX + prompt engineering + technical writing |

The pattern is clear: **domain expertise combined with prompt engineering commands significant market premium**. An instructional designer who can effectively collaborate with AI tools represents a different value proposition than either a traditional ID or a general-purpose prompt engineer.

### 2.2 Cross-Functional Team Structures in Industry

Technology companies and progressive educational institutions have moved from siloed departments to outcome-aligned teams. Key characteristics:

**Stream-Aligned Teams** (Team Topologies framework):
- Aligned to a single valuable stream of work
- Empowered to build and deliver without requiring handoffs
- Cross-functional composition covering all needed capabilities
- Clear ownership and reduced coordination costs

**Curriculum Design Teams** (RMIT University Global Learning by Design):
- Include academic and support staff
- Use Agile project management principles
- Produce reusable design patterns
- Drive cultural shift in program development

**Business and Industry Leadership Teams** (Collin College BILT model):
- Industry experts actively co-lead programs
- Validate specific knowledge, skills, and abilities
- Regular collaboration with clear deliverables
- Move beyond annual advisory board meetings

### 2.3 Agile Instructional Design Adoption

Traditional ADDIE models (Analyze-Design-Develop-Implement-Evaluate) assume stable requirements and sequential handoffs. Agile instructional design recognizes that:

- Requirements evolve as understanding deepens
- Iterative development with frequent feedback produces higher quality
- Cross-functional collaboration throughout the process reduces rework
- Smaller increments enable faster course corrections

Agile curriculum development teams typically use:
- **Kanban boards** for visual work management
- **Sprint cycles** (2-4 weeks) for focused development
- **User stories** defining learner-facing outcomes
- **Daily standups** for coordination and blocker removal
- **Retrospectives** for continuous process improvement

This methodology maps directly to software development workflows—which means a team including a software developer brings both domain expertise and process fluency.

## Section 3: Proposed Team Structure

### 3.1 Team Composition

**Core Team Members:**

| Role | Current Position | Time Allocation | Primary Contribution |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Software Developer | CIT Faculty | Existing workload | Domain expertise, GitHub workflow, AI tool fluency, agile methodology |
| Prompt Engineering Specialist | Instructional Designer (separate department) | 4-8 hours/week (protected) | Instructional design, prompt engineering, accessibility compliance, accreditation alignment |
| Visual Designer | Graphic Design Staff | Project-based | Visual asset creation, brand consistency, multimedia development |

**Interaction Model:**
- Synchronous collaboration: 2-4 hours/week scheduled
- Asynchronous coordination: GitHub Issues, project board
- Stakeholder touchpoints: Bi-weekly with subject matter experts, monthly with administration

### 3.2 Why This Composition Works

The team composition mirrors industry patterns for AI-assisted development:

**Software Developer as Technical Lead:**
- Maintains GitHub infrastructure and workflow standards
- Provides direct expertise in the subject matter (AI tools, development practices)
- Brings agile methodology fluency to the curriculum process
- Can validate technical accuracy of AI-generated content

**Prompt Engineering Specialist as Instructional Architect:**
- Translates learning objectives into effective AI interactions
- Ensures pedagogical soundness and accessibility compliance
- Maintains alignment with accreditation requirements

## Section 7: Faculty-Focused Summary

*For faculty colleagues interested in this model:*

### What We're Actually Doing

Building a small, focused team to develop CSC-113 using modern software development practices—the same practices we teach students. Instead of the traditional "write content → send to ID → wait → get it back → revise" cycle, we're working together continuously with:

- **Kanban board** showing what's in progress
- **GitHub issues** tracking specific tasks
- **2-week sprints** producing usable chunks
- **AI tools** accelerating content creation
- **Peer review** catching problems early

### Why It Matters for You

If this works, we'll have:
- A model that cuts development time in half or more
- Documented templates you can use for your courses
- Prompt libraries for common instructional tasks
- A case study showing administration this approach works

### What We Need

The main thing: **formalized collaboration time** with an instructional designer who has prompt engineering skills. We're not asking for new hires or budget—just administrative blessing to coordinate across department lines.

### The Bigger Picture

This is also professional development in both directions. The ID learns our domain and our workflows. We learn instructional design principles properly. Both sides get documented experience with AI-assisted development. Everybody wins.
