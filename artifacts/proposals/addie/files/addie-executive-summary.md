# ADDIE Reimagined: Executive Summary

## AI-Assisted Instructional Development Pilot Proposal

---

## The Problem

Traditional curriculum development takes **6-12 months** from concept to classroom. For AI-related content, this timeline guarantees outdated material before students see it. The institution has capable professionals across departments—but no mechanism to coordinate their expertise efficiently.

---

## The Solution: ADDIE Reimagined

**A**gile **D**esign & **D**evelopment with **I**terative **E**nhancement

A cross-functional pilot team applying modern development practices to curriculum creation:

| Classic ADDIE | ADDIE Reimagined |
|---------------|------------------|
| Sequential phases | Iterative sprints |
| 6-12 month cycles | 8-16 week delivery |
| Handoffs between silos | Continuous collaboration |
| Evaluation at the end | Feedback throughout |
| AI as afterthought | AI-assisted from day one |

The methodology honors what IDs trust about structured design while adapting for AI-era realities.

## The Ask

**No budget transfer. No FTE reallocation.**

Only: **Formalized collaboration time** (4-8 hours/week) for an instructional designer to work alongside CIT faculty on the CSC-113 AI Fundamentals pilot, structured through an MOU/SLA.

---

## Benefits

**For Instructional Design/Accreditation:**
- Professional development in AI-assisted methodology
- Documented innovative practice for HLC evidence
- Reusable templates and prompt libraries
- Credit on institutional AI readiness narrative

**For CIT:**
- Access to instructional design expertise
- Accelerated, higher-quality curriculum
- Accessible, accreditation-aligned materials
- Scalable model for future courses

**For the Institution:**
- Demonstrated AI integration capability
- 40-60% faster curriculum development
- Cross-departmental collaboration model
- Workforce-aligned student outcomes

---

## Pilot Scope

**Project:** CSC-113 AI Fundamentals (8 modules)  
**Timeline:** 16 weeks  
**Team:** CIT faculty + ID specialist + visual design support  
**Deliverables:** 16 readings, 18 tutorials, 14 labs, 3 projects, 4 rubrics

**Success Metrics:**
- Development cycle: 8 weeks per module pair (vs. 6-12 months traditional)
- Quality: Zero critical accessibility issues
- Satisfaction: 4+/5 from participants
- Efficiency: 40%+ improvement documented

---

## Decision Requested

Authorize development of MOU/SLA framework for the ADDIE Reimagined pilot, enabling protected collaboration time between CIT and Instructional Design for CSC-113 development.

**Risk:** Bounded 16-week pilot with defined evaluation point  
**Cost:** Zero additional budget  
**Upside:** Scalable model for institutional curriculum innovation
