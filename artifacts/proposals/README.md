Done. Complete ADDIE Reimagined package:
Three documents, same strategic structure:

Executive Summary — One-pager for VP/Dean. Problem → ADDIE Reimagined solution → Ask (MOU for protected time) → Benefits → Decision request.
Role Posting — Job-posting format for ID specialist recruitment. Explains methodology, time commitment, what they'll gain professionally. Emphasizes this is career-positioning in an emerging specialty.
Full Research Report — Comprehensive proposal with industry data, methodology detail, pilot scope, administrative framework, appendices including the full ADDIE Reimagined breakdown and sample MOU language.

The ADDIE framing advantage:

IDs see familiar territory being evolved, not replaced
The comparison tables (Classic vs. Reimagined) do the persuasion work
"The wisdom remains valid. The assumption that it must be sequential and AI-free does not."
Administration sees structured methodology with clear phases—not wild west agile chaos

ALIGN stays in reserve for when you need a fresh brand that signals "strategic initiative" rather than "evolved practice." Different audiences, different frames.
You now have both sets. A/B away.
