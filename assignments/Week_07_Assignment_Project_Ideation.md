# Week 7 Assignment: "Project Ideation"
## CSC-113 AI Fundamentals - Finding Your AI Application Project

**Due**: End of Week 7 (Friday, 11:59 PM)
**Points**: 25 (25% of Module 4 grade)
**Submission**: Via GitHub repository (PR #7)

---

## ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

This week marks the beginning of your capstone project journey. You'll brainstorm at least **three potential ideas** for how you could use AI tools to solve a real problem or create something useful in your life.

**Important:** This is just ideation - you're exploring possibilities, not committing to anything final yet. The best projects often start by brainstorming multiple options before choosing the most exciting and achievable one.

**What is "Ideation"?**
Ideation is the creative process of generating and exploring ideas. Think of it as brainstorming without judgment. You might:
- Suggest the same basic idea three different ways
- Propose one wildly ambitious idea and two modest ones
- Explore completely different directions

**There are no bad ideas in ideation.** Even ideas that seem impractical can lead to better ones.

**What You're Learning:**
- Creative problem identification
- Scope assessment for technical projects
- AI tool selection based on project requirements
- Professional project proposal writing
- Self-reflection on interests and capabilities

**Connection to Track Selection:**
This week, you should also **finalize your track choice** (Code Builders vs Prompt Masters). Your project ideas should align with your chosen track, but don't let the track limit your creativity - both tracks can build impressive projects!

---

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By completing this assignment, you will:
1. Identify real problems in your life that AI could help solve
2. Generate multiple creative project ideas
3. Assess project scope realistically
4. Select appropriate AI tools for specific purposes
5. Articulate project ideas clearly and professionally
6. Connect personal interests to technical capabilities

## PART 1: BRAINSTORMING (1 hour)

### Step 1: Discovery Prompts

Before diving into ideas, use AI to help you brainstorm. These prompts work well with any AI tool:

**Discovery Prompt 1: Personal Connection**
```
I'm a [your major/field] student looking for an AI project idea. I'm interested in
[your hobbies/interests]. What are some creative ways I could use AI tools to
build something useful related to these interests?
```

**Discovery Prompt 2: Problem Finding**
```
What problems in my daily life as a [student/your situation] could AI help solve?
Think about common frustrations, repetitive tasks, or things I wish existed.
```

**Discovery Prompt 3: Skill Building**
```
I want to learn more about [specific AI capability - prompting/coding/automation].
What kinds of projects would help me develop these skills while creating something
genuinely useful?
```

**Discovery Prompt 4: Inspiration**
```
What are some creative uses of AI tools like [your preferred tools] that would
make a good semester project for a college student? The project should be
achievable in 4-6 weeks of part-time work.
```

**Document:** Save interesting responses in `week-07-ideation/brainstorm-notes.md`

### Step 2: Reality Check Prompts

Once you have some initial ideas, test them:

**Prompt for Feasibility:**
```
I'm thinking about building [your idea]. I have [your time frame] to work on it
and I'm [beginner/intermediate] with [relevant skills]. Is this achievable?
What would be the minimum viable version?
```

**Prompt for Uniqueness:**
```
I want to build [your idea]. What would make this interesting or unique?
How could I add a personal twist that makes it portfolio-worthy?
```

## WHAT MAKES A GOOD PROJECT IDEA?

### Good Project Characteristics

**Solves a Real Problem**
The best projects address something you actually care about. "AI for studying" is generic. "AI that quizzes me on organic chemistry using my professor's exam format" is specific and useful.

**Uses AI Meaningfully**
AI should be central to the solution, not tacked on. Ask: "Would this project work without AI?" If yes, find a more AI-appropriate problem.

**Achievable Scope**
You have 4-6 weeks of part-time work. A "complete AI operating system" isn't realistic. A "custom assistant that helps with one specific task" is.

**Demonstrates Learning**
Your project should show what you've learned in this course - prompt engineering, tool selection, iteration, documentation.

**Portfolio-Worthy**
You'll show this to employers or grad schools. Is it something you're proud of? Does it demonstrate real skills?

**Personally Interesting**
You'll work on this for weeks. If you're not interested, it will show. Pick something you actually want to build.

### Warning Signs

**Too Vague**
- "Use AI to help students" → Help them do what? Study? Write? Research?
- "Make an AI assistant" → For whom? For what tasks?

**Too Simple**
- "Ask ChatGPT questions" → That's just using a tool, not a project
- "Compare two AI tools" → That's Week 6, not a capstone

**Too Ambitious**
- "Build the next Google" → Scale it WAY down
- "Create an AI that writes entire novels" → Focus on one chapter, one genre

**Not AI-Focused**
- "Build a website" → Where's the AI component?
- "Make a mobile app" → Is AI central or an afterthought?

**Purely Hypothetical**
- "AI that could cure diseases someday" → What can you ACTUALLY build?

## COMMON MISTAKES & TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I can't think of any ideas"

**Fix**: Start with your pain points:
- What's the most annoying part of your day?
- What do you waste time on?
- What do you wish existed?
- What manual tasks could be automated?

Also: What are you genuinely interested in? Projects work better when you care.

---

### "All my ideas seem too hard or too easy"

**Fix**: You need one of each!
- One "safe" idea you're confident you can complete
- One "stretch" idea that challenges you
- One "middle" idea that balances ambition and achievability

This gives you options when you finalize.

---

### "My ideas are too similar to each other"

**Fix**: Force variety by constraining yourself:
- Idea 1: For personal use
- Idea 2: For someone else (family, friends, community)
- Idea 3: For your professional/academic life

Or vary by:
- AI tool used
- Output type (assistant vs. workflow vs. analysis)
- Complexity level

---

### "I don't know which track to choose"

**Fix**: Consider:
- **Code Builders** if: You enjoy programming, want API experience, like building from scratch
- **Prompt Masters** if: You prefer no-code, want business applications, like UX design

Remember: Both tracks are equally rigorous. Neither is "easier." Pick based on interest, not difficulty.

---

### "My idea doesn't fit neatly into either track"

**Fix**: Most ideas can work for either track with different approaches:
- **Code Builders approach**: Build it with code and APIs
- **Prompt Masters approach**: Build it with no-code platforms and advanced prompting

Document how you'd approach it for your track.

---

## GETTING HELP

### Idea Development
- **Stuck on brainstorming**: Share your interests in #class-discussion
- **Not sure about scope**: Ask "Is this achievable in 6 weeks?"
- **Unsure about originality**: Originality isn't required - just add your personal twist

### Track Selection
- **Still undecided**: Office hours for guidance
- **Want to switch**: You can switch until Week 8
- **Worried about skills**: Both tracks include learning new things

### Technical Questions
- **What tools are available**: Check course resources
- **What APIs are free**: Ask in class discussion
- **What platforms work best**: See examples above

---

## LOOKING AHEAD

### Week 8 Preview: Track Specialization
Next week, you'll:
- Explore tools specific to your track
- Begin refining your project choice
- Get feedback on your ideas
- Start preliminary work

### What Happens Next?
1. **Week 7** (now): Generate 3+ ideas
2. **Week 8**: Get feedback, finalize choice
3. **Week 9**: Create detailed project plan
4. **Weeks 10-14**: Build your project
5. **Weeks 15-16**: Present and document

**For now, just focus on exploring possibilities.**
